I think the model is correct

Now I need to start to create ways to interact with it

I think I need the following views:
	1) Create Users
	2) Log in as a user (there must be an authentication library of some sort I can track down
	3) View active threads (the default view)
	4) View a specific thread, with reply options
	4) Create a new thread
	5) Reply to an active thread


I also need to create ways to do these things in the admin site:
	1) View & create users
	2) View & create groups
	3) View & create threads
	4) View & create messages
	5) View the above by user
